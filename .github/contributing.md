# Contributing
Hey there! Thank you for your interest in my project. If you wish to contribute code or new features, here are some guidelines and helpful information.

## What prior knowledge do I need

These will mostly apply to programmers who wish to contribute. If you are a sound designer or a composer there are other ways to contribute as well. Refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/alexfonseka/godot-fmod-integration/new/master/.github#contribution-guidelines) section.

- You would need some basic knowledge of C++ and the FMOD API. 
- A basic understanding of how the Godot game engine works. 
- A basic understanding of Python scripting and the SCons build system.
